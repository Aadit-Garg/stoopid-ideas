            <p>So! i am <em class="brackets"><a href="http://">Aadit</a></em>, I am creating this blog/diary site for
                fun and to
                face my
                public anxiety
                It's hard for me to open up in public but not any more <em class="brackets">(I guess😬)</em>.
                It can also be taken as a mental experiment that will writing blogs help me
                overcome my anxiety and help me open up.
                I believe this journey will be full of vivid emotions filled with life lessons, puns,
                heartbreaks <em class="brackets">(not really😅)</em>, witty incidents, study stuff <em
                    class="brackets">(as I am in high school😌)</em>.
                <br>Don't know whether someone gonna read it or not, though 😐.
                <br>
                <br>My objective is not to offend anyone in any shape or form.
                <br>
                <br><em class="brackets">(Why am I even doing this!!)</em>
                <br>
                <br> It will be a 50-day <em class="quote">``blog my life`` </em> challenge and I may continue it
                as my leisure.
                <br>

            Hi! <br>
            So it's day-1 nothing intresting is going on other than I am writing this blog at <br>
            1:30 am 😂 it's 10 Jan (11 Jan actually) and my pre-boards start from 16 man I am not confident enough
            I am planning to give next 5 days purely to revising first exam is of Hindi, the one I am worst in.
            <br><br>
            Ya but I remember something, few weeks back I had my ASL (Assessment of Speaking and Listening) I was tense
            so in ASL two students argue on different topics and interrogate each other.
            When me and my partner took the seat I accidentally hit my teacher, it was clearly not my intention,
            the teacher got furious but she thought the child sitting next to me did it.
            she scolded him so bad as apparently he didn't even apologized I was sitting there watching all her
            fury bursting over him. I was feeling so guilty but my scare didn't let me say a thing.
            She is the teacher I have met so far but it is one of the guilt which floods my mind before I sleep
            (yes, there are a few more), I think I will apologize the next day but I guess I don't have the guts all
            though that teacher is a really good friend of mine, I look at her as a mentor. Even, she is the reason I
            am writing this today, she gave me the advice to write diary to express my feellings and wither away my
            anxiety.
            I thought of taking it a step further and write public diaries(believe me it's hard). So I guess I will
            never apologize her and him and regret my decision. 😐
            <br><br>
            Inference : Never! ever! lie. being silent is also considered as a filthy lie and will make you regret
            and feel guilty only. Better speak the truth no matter the acute consequences.
            <br>
            Thank-You for reading!
