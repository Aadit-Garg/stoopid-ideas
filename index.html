            <p>So! i am <em class="brackets"><a href="http://">Aadit</a></em>, I am creating this blog/diary site for
                fun and to
                face my
                public anxiety
                Its hard for me to open up in public but not any more <em class="brackets">(I guess😬)</em>.
                It can also be taken as a mental experiment that will writing blogs help me
                overcome my anxiety and help me open up.
                I believe this journey will be full of vivid emotions filled with life lessons, puns,
                heartbreaks <em class="brackets">(not really😅)</em>, witty incidents, study stuff <em
                    class="brackets">(as I am in high school😌)</em>.
                <br>Don't know whether someone gonna read it or not, though 😐.
                <br>
                <br>My objective is not to offend anyone in any shape or form.
                <br>
                <br><em class="brackets">(Why am I even doing this.)</em>
                <br>
                <br> It will be a 50-day <em class="quote">``blog my life`` </em> challenge and I may continue it
                as my leisure.
                <br>
