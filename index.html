            <p>So! i am <em class="brackets"><a href="http://">Aadit</a></em>, I am creating this blog/diary site for
                fun and to
                face my
                public anxiety
                It's hard for me to open up in public but not any more <em class="brackets">(I guess😬)</em>.
                It can also be taken as a mental experiment that will writing blogs help me
                overcome my anxiety and help me open up.
                I believe this journey will be full of vivid emotions filled with life lessons, puns,
                heartbreaks <em class="brackets">(not really😅)</em>, witty incidents, study stuff <em
                    class="brackets">(as I am in high school😌)</em>.
                <br>Don't know whether someone gonna read it or not, though 😐.
                <br>
                <br>My objective is not to offend anyone in any shape or form.
                <br>
                <br><em class="brackets">(Why am I even doing this!!)</em>
                <br>
                <br> It will be a 50-day <em class="quote">``blog my life`` </em> challenge and I may continue it
                as my leisure.
                <br>

        <p>
            Bonjour!<br>
            Day-2 hmm! surprising, made it so far. Well I guess it's the same time today 1:30 am
            and I am banging some nice music. But, today there is something nice I lost 1.2kg
            of weight ooo!🎉🎉 in around 3 weeks I dont know how's it's possible, ya, I changed
            my diet but believe me the change was abysmal, I didn't exercised more or anything,
            cycling maybe about 2-3km not much but yaa more or less it's fine (as long as it's not life threatning or
            something😅). My BMI(Body Mass Index) is normalish 20 something.
            <br><br>
            Nothing much happend <em>[`Currently the author is going through the boring repetitive stage of
                life,though it will perish slowly but surely`]</em> but lets think of something else.
            <br>
            I have toooo much rant but can't say it all in one day.
            Oh! speaking of units, our books are worst at it. Like sometimes they use KM then
            at other times it is Miles or Feets, sometimes Kelvin other times it's °Celcius,
            not even that sometimes they write M/S² other times it becomes MS⁻², I know it doesn't
            matter but I guess they can't choose a side, either British or American(It's tough I know)
            well but can't they atleast follow the same allover.
            <br>
            Also, Currently my social interaction is underoot(-1); yes, imaginary (those who didn't got it root(-1) =
            [i]maginary) my best friend is busy with their college my last chat was if not months then weeks ago
            (that too unread). I dont know why I always end with gloom.
            <br>
            Thats the wrap for now, Thank-You for reading!

            Hi! <br>
            So it's day-1 nothing intresting is going on other than I am writing this blog at <br>
            1:30 am 😂 it's 10 Jan (11 Jan actually) and my pre-boards start from 16 man I am not confident enough
            I am planning to give next 5 days purely to revising first exam is of Hindi, the one I am worst in.
            <br><br>
            Ya but I remember something, few weeks back I had my ASL (Assessment of Speaking and Listening) I was tense
            so in ASL two students argue on different topics and interrogate each other.
            When me and my partner took the seat I accidentally hit my teacher, it was clearly not my intention,
            the teacher got furious but she thought the child sitting next to me did it.
            she scolded him so bad as apparently he didn't even apologized I was sitting there watching all her
            fury bursting over him. I was feeling so guilty but my scare didn't let me say a thing.
            She is the teacher I have met so far but it is one of the guilt which floods my mind before I sleep
            (yes, there are a few more), I think I will apologize the next day but I guess I don't have the guts all
            though that teacher is a really good friend of mine, I look at her as a mentor. Even, she is the reason I
            am writing this today, she gave me the advice to write diary to express my feellings and wither away my
            anxiety.
            I thought of taking it a step further and write public diaries(believe me it's hard). So I guess I will
            never apologize her and him and regret my decision. 😐
            <br><br>
            Inference : Never! ever! lie. being silent is also considered as a filthy lie and will make you regret
            and feel guilty only. Better speak the truth no matter the acute consequences.
            <br>
