            <p>So! i am <em class="brackets"><a href="http://">Aadit</a></em>, I am creating this blog/diary site for
                fun and to
                face my
                public anxiety
                It's hard for me to open up in public but not any more <em class="brackets">(I guessüò¨)</em>.
                It can also be taken as a mental experiment that will writing blogs help me
                overcome my anxiety and help me open up.
                I believe this journey will be full of vivid emotions filled with life lessons, puns,
                heartbreaks <em class="brackets">(not reallyüòÖ)</em>, witty incidents, study stuff <em
                    class="brackets">(as I am in high schoolüòå)</em>.
                <br>Don't know whether someone gonna read it or not, though üòê.
                <br>
                <br>My objective is not to offend anyone in any shape or form.
                <br>
                <br><em class="brackets">(Why am I even doing this!!)</em>
                <br>
                <br> It will be a 50-day <em class="quote">``blog my life`` </em> challenge and I may continue it
                as my leisure.

            Konnichiwa!<br>
            Day-4 So I again had a study duo today and man that boy is overachiever in extracurriculars,
            he just won gold medal in national championship for shooting under 17 and will be competing
            for freaking Olympics Jeez, like how, and still a nice person. that there is something I can't
            think of, I used to do fencing and was really good in it like i nailed foil in it the most difficult
            one, <em>(there are three weapons in fencing "Foil", "√âp√©e" & "Sabre";Even the ruels change too)</em>,
            as you can only hit torso, with a wobbly blade, and was fine in other two. I was best in footwork in the
            whole group, I was even teaching new students, and not just that the teacher was so humble, friendly, even
            helped with workout and told how to fix some common joint dislocations, but I left it about 2 years backüòê.
            I don't know why though but it was free.To go to the practice <em>(which was in school)</em> I actually
            bunked the first and last timeüòÖ. Good old times orth remembering, he gave us punishment like 20 min fencing
            walk under direct sun with all gear on "I am so sure we alway loose 0.5 kg weight after practice", it was
            the first time when I really felt dedication, so there's this lunge move in there is a jump variation where
            have to long-jump with high velocity and dash and aim for torso, it was so hard, the teach told us that move
            for like 100 times but he wasn't frustrated and that time it was dedication pushing us. It took 30 hours of
            practice to learn it and 20 hrs more to nail it, but we got itüòÄ.
            <br>
            I am tired and can't think of anything else so no 2nd para.

        <p>
            Hola!<br>
            Day-3 it's hat-trick noice. So, lets see, today, I had group study or more like study duo
            it was nice, more like competion, what else ? Hmm! today I was not procastinating I was, I guess,
            just more occupied by contemplation and stuff like really deep one about like. I noticed in my english book
            most of the poems are there to tell how a bad a man is. Like in the poem <em>"For Anne Gregory"</em>
            captures the idea that men can't actually love women from heart, inetrnally or purely <em>"without any
                intention"</em>, they are hypnotised
            by their beauty or any of the physical characteristic, "like every man is flattered by Anne's honey
            locks(ramparts) in poem"
            it also conveys that he would stop loving her if she got rid of those lock. I am not the person of choise to
            counter this but as per my grasp it's not true well surely beauty or physique is one of the reasons but not
            the only reason even beatuy is just relative. Surely, what I like, someone will not like it. And saying men
            are heartless lust machines isn't right. But, maybe a BIG BUT the poem is trying to convey some higher level
            meaning which my mind can't currently absorb than I can be wrong, also I don't know enough of whatever this
            is.
            <br><br>
            Well, I guess just leave it, let's talk about grammar. I alway thought plural of person is people, but no
            its not true it can be persons too, infact in official documents the use persons as persons reffers to a
            group of people but each person distinctively and not as one body. Also peoples is also a legit word, whatt?
            Similarly, It reffers to different group of people but each group distinctively, for eg. <em>"Peoples of
                different races."</em> instead of <em>"People of different races."</em>
            Thats actually a bit strange.

        <p>
            Bonjour!<br>
            Day-2 hmm! surprising, made it so far. Well I guess it's the same time today 1:30 am
            and I am banging some nice music. But, today there is something nice I lost 1.2kg
            of weight ooo!üéâüéâ in around 3 weeks I dont know how's it's possible, ya, I changed
            my diet but believe me the change was abysmal, I didn't exercised more or anything,
            cycling maybe about 2-3km not much but yaa more or less it's fine (as long as it's not life threatning or
            somethingüòÖ). My BMI(Body Mass Index) is normalish 20 something.
            <br><br>
            Nothing much happend <em>[`Currently the author is going through the boring repetitive stage of
                life,though it will perish slowly but surely`]</em> but lets think of something else.
            <br>
            I have toooo much rant but can't say it all in one day.
            Oh! speaking of units, our books are worst at it. Like sometimes they use KM then
            at other times it is Miles or Feets, sometimes Kelvin other times it's ¬∞Celcius,
            not even that sometimes they write M/S¬≤ other times it becomes MS‚Åª¬≤, I know it doesn't
            matter but I guess they can't choose a side, either British or American(It's tough I know)
            well but can't they atleast follow the same allover.
            <br>
            Also, Currently my social interaction is underoot(-1); yes, imaginary (those who didn't got it root(-1) =
            [i]maginary) my best friend is busy with their college my last chat was if not months then weeks ago
            (that too unread). I dont know why I always end with gloom.
            <br>

            Hi! <br>
            So it's day-1 nothing intresting is going on other than I am writing this blog at <br>
            1:30 am üòÇ it's 10 Jan (11 Jan actually) and my pre-boards start from 16 man I am not confident enough
            I am planning to give next 5 days purely to revising first exam is of Hindi, the one I am worst in.
            <br><br>
            Ya but I remember something, few weeks back I had my ASL (Assessment of Speaking and Listening) I was tense
            so in ASL two students argue on different topics and interrogate each other.
            When me and my partner took the seat I accidentally hit my teacher, it was clearly not my intention,
            the teacher got furious but she thought the child sitting next to me did it.
            she scolded him so bad as apparently he didn't even apologized I was sitting there watching all her
            fury bursting over him. I was feeling so guilty but my scare didn't let me say a thing.
            She is the teacher I have met so far but it is one of the guilt which floods my mind before I sleep
            (yes, there are a few more), I think I will apologize the next day but I guess I don't have the guts all
            though that teacher is a really good friend of mine, I look at her as a mentor. Even, she is the reason I
            am writing this today, she gave me the advice to write diary to express my feellings and wither away my
            anxiety.
            I thought of taking it a step further and write public diaries(believe me it's hard). So I guess I will
            never apologize her and him and regret my decision. üòê
            <br><br>
            Inference : Never! ever! lie. being silent is also considered as a filthy lie and will make you regret
            and feel guilty only. Better speak the truth no matter the acute consequences.
