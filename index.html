            <p>So! i am <em class="brackets"><a href="http://">Aadit</a></em>, I am creating this blog/diary site for
                fun and to
                face my
                public anxiety
                It's hard for me to open up in public but not any more <em class="brackets">(I guess😬)</em>.
                It can also be taken as a mental experiment that will writing blogs help me
                overcome my anxiety and help me open up.
                I believe this journey will be full of vivid emotions filled with life lessons, puns,
                heartbreaks <em class="brackets">(not really😅)</em>, witty incidents, study stuff <em
                    class="brackets">(as I am in high school😌)</em>.
                <br>Don't know whether someone gonna read it or not, though 😐.
                <br>
                <br>My objective is not to offend anyone in any shape or form.

            Hola!
            <br>
            Day 17,<br>
            So today was a holiday but it was so unholy for me because tommorow I have to go to school, aand they will give us our subject marks, nothing makes me more
            tense than this, I would have a little less tense if only I have someone to share this with like a friend or asibling, but ya can't be sad for what I never
            got. I can't even share this with my parents. Speaking of parents, <br>
            I thing I have got like most chill, modern parents, so I am Hindu and that too, pure veg,but my parents have no problem with me eating meat and stuff, not
            beef though <em>(it's sacred)</em>. Even though they know my phone passcode they never check my phone, like NEVER, they trust me, also I have nothing to
            hide too. So, which parent want to their child be on social media, and I am not on any of the social media, but my father asks me why am I not on any
            LIKE WHATT.... So any child I met, they don't go to gym, because there parents don't allow them, my parents freaking force me, but still I dont go.
            They don't force me to believe in any of the superstition, although they too, don't believe in many. I can't cover all of them in one write. And my
            tensenes is killing me, so maybe meet you tomorrow!.

            Hola!
            <br>
            Day 16,<br>
            I was so confident that this time I was going to crush it in math, but I guess I can never keep up with my goals, man, I am a failure.Today's exam was 
            worth a 100%, but only because of my stupid mistakes I am only going to get 94-93%, I know it's not that bad, but, well, I failed to meet my expectations,
            and I guess, No procastination, No distractions, No more hefty screen time, No more anything, and I, I promise this, well ! months till boards and believe
            me I am gonna Blast it this time. Well, So here's my schedule daily Maths, Science, S.S.Sc. , 4 times a week English, Comp.Sc. and I will try my best to 
            follow it, Let's see how it goes. I don't know how to get away from procastination though, I don't know why I waste so much time as leisure or else I am 
            not gonna full-fill, if not mine, atleast not even my teach's, my parent's expectations. Well they don't give me any pressure though. They are OK with
            above 90% but I am not, I will always have the guilt that even if I could have given my 100% I didn't because of stupid time wastes. Let it be. Enough 
            of guff.<br>
            Some Spicy stuff!<br>
            SO it's when I was in 9th, I was sitting on the last bench the person sitting Right to me brought Mobile Phone <em>(which was Prohibited at the time,
             infact, still prohibited)</em>. Well so far nothing Extra-Ordinary but during the lecture, he took out the phone and started playing a video, and it
            was not good, not good, he started watching <em>adult content</em>, I could clearly hear the moaning sounds and it was so bad, do he even have a lfe 
            other than lust, just ruining his life, he's not even the right age🤦‍♂️, he got luck no one complained against him or else. Like where do these people
            get such "Ideas" and he was rusticated (suspended) from school like 5 times, and he's still popular. I thought it only happens in my school but my sis
            told me it's same everywhere. One time he got rusticated for vaping in the class during lecture, like WTH. One time he abused a teacher infront of that
            teacher. Well he was once, punched from a teacher like he completely made that teacher furious, he didn't came school for like 5 days after that because
            of obviously stomach pain.

            Hola!
            <br>
            So day 14 huh!, I guess I am 28% in it. Lessgo!.
            So Today I had my S.S.Sc. exam, it was a tough but still a easy one, I am expecting 95-96%.
            We have a 3-hour exam of 80 marks. Today the teacher who was supposed to collect our answer sheets felt funny and dizy. 
            He almost passed out, but he called another teacher to collect the paper, So, nothing dramatic happened. I had a fun day with friends,
            like we drank cold lemonade in this freezing weather😂 and was discussing the exam, and believe me, discussing exam is reallyyy... fun unless you
            find that your answer was  wrong, Ahhh!. And I, I, I didn't study AT ALL!😅. I know that I am being a moron but like one day isn't that... bad. What else 
            I am not currently in the mood of expressing more because,.... I don't know, maybe I am feeling tired and that <em> mere splash of raindrop from 
            not so far is making me feel a lil' lonely but quite nice </em> don't know why though. I still wonder who read my this guff, I know one, my friend, but
            don't know about others....

            Hello!
            <br>
            First of all I uploaded day-8 on time but its just that I uploaded it in the wrong repo. So today I had my
            English exam and it went somewhat well, I am hoping for 93-95%, a bit of silly mistakes here and there. This
            time I wrote the exam in a different style not my usual one, and I GUESS, I did better this time, let's see.
            So next is of scince and I hope I atleast do well in it. But I just cant hope <em>ykwim</em>. What else,
            ya is it only me who gets that anxiety when you discuss the question paper with classsmates and they didn't
            wrote what you wrote, even though you know you are right, I feel that, and my instinct's hardly ever wrong.
            <br><br>
            Ya, so about the math story, I literally loves math, but it always wasn't the case. when I was in 1st - 2nd
            standard I used to hate math. So during summer breaks every child loves to visit to their uncle's (mother's
            brother),
            but I absolutely hated that. Why ? Because mamu (uncle) before going to work used to give me sums which I
            was
            suppose to do, and you don't want to know what happens when I don't do those😂. And weekends were
            nightmares🤣, now I
            think of it, it's nostalgic and funny, but after some time all my questions started getting write and I got
            rid
            of so called <em>"Math-O-Phobia"</em>. Now I get fascinated by all its possibilities and how some handfull
            of
            rules and formulas can tell the third side of a right triangle📐 or area of square🟨 or even do complex
            calculations<br>
            It's, It's literally ✨<em>amazing</em>✨.

            Hello! <br>
            So where should I even start, today was fun, really fun. Today I broke many rules. Underage driving, riding
            without helmet, even tripling. It was fun though, when you do such stuff with friends. went on a really long
            walk with them too I geuss it was 6km or something. My Hindi exam also went kinda okayish yesterday. I am
            hoping for 90%, most of my random guesses were correct so it really boosted my percentage by around 5-6% I
            guess. But tommorow is English Exam and I am really scared for it, not because parents or anything, but my
            teacher. She have some unreal expectations from me, why so much trust over me, she said I can easily score
            98% this time, and as far as I know that's too much to ask for. My grammar is good enough that its not going
            to disappoint me my literature good too, but I cram things, I love to answer by theoretical approches I can
            write with complete Independece in such questions, but what I am scared about is the difficulty of exam, and
            that teacher never gives full score in writing and lit portion unless your answers are exceptionaly great,
            which is nearly impossible within a 3 hour time span, but lets see. <br><br>
            I am sure this writing stuff is really helping, slowly but surely. but still don't know why I get so many
            mood swings, it can be bipolar don't know though. I guess I need to control over many stuff, like
            procastinating, anger, and many more emotions. I guess it all happens because I feel lonely most of the
            times I dont know why. In my family every like every single cousin of mine have a sibling but, you geussed
            it right, not me. I always wanted a sibling, but never had one. even al the friends, classmates I have met
            so far have a sibling. I always feels a little zoned out and tbh envious, seeing them have a peculiar,
            intimate connection. I never felt that. They alway had someone to hold their backs. I never had anyone, not
            even a elder mentor. And how can we forget those silly fights. The stuff you can't tell to even your parents
            you can tell that to them😐. Ya but fine, everything I get I never need to share it😌.

            Namaste!<br>
            Day-6, So, tommorow finnaly my Hindi exam, so this is going to be a concise one.
            I am a little bit confident about my grammar and writing portion I didn't did any literature though. Becase
            the exam is going to theoretical based and I can write good theories. I am hoping for around 90% in Hindi
            well, it's just my expectation. What else can I talk about. Next exam is of English, I guess I can do well
            in it though. The math story I will write tommorow,it's intresting.
            <br><br>
            I don't know why people don't like talking with me I guess I am boring or Introvert but the first one makes
            sense, or I guess I am weird, when I get a little friendly I ask too personal questions, and I guess thats
            why the ignore me instead of telling me <em>(or I can be exaggerating they just dont like me or really busy
                to listen to my guff)</em>. I can't do anything though😐. Well, it happens with me very often. I am not
            even on any of the social media. Don't know why though. I guess thisk experiment will help me get all my
            answers. or it is just another mistake, no one knows.

            I know it's a bit cliché and cheesy, but it works.I don't why I am not worried for exam though,
            I never wanted to study Hindi, I was never good in it. I love English, Maths, Science, History
            and Computer Sc. .The Maths story I will tell tomorrow, but I am great in English "atleast my teach says
            that", like she said I am a man with great ideas and write theoretical answers better than the one with 100%
            marks (No braggin'), although I dont think so😅.I don't write much though but I have a few poems and I am
            little
            tired now, not sure that can write more. So, it's it for now. It's a bit short though (Like someone reads it
            "I dont think so").

        <p>
            Konnichiwa!<br>
            Day-4 So I again had a study duo today and man that boy is overachiever in extracurriculars,
            he just won gold medal in national championship for shooting under 17 and will be competing
            for freaking Olympics Jeez, like how, and still a nice person. that there is something I can't
            think of, I used to do fencing and was really good in it like i nailed foil in it the most difficult
            one, <em>(there are three weapons in fencing "Foil", "Épée" & "Sabre";Even the ruels change too)</em>,
            as you can only hit torso, with a wobbly blade, and was fine in other two. I was best in footwork in the
            whole group, I was even teaching new students, and not just that the teacher was so humble, friendly,
            even
            helped with workout and told how to fix some common joint dislocations, but I left it about 2 years
            back😐.
            I don't know why though but it was free.To go to the practice <em>(which was in school)</em> I actually
            bunked the first and last time😅. Good old times orth remembering, he gave us punishment like 20 min
            fencing
            walk under direct sun with all gear on "I am so sure we alway loose 0.5 kg weight after practice", it
            was
            the first time when I really felt dedication, so there's this lunge move in there is a jump variation
            where
            have to long-jump with high velocity and dash and aim for torso, it was so hard, the teach told us that
            move
            for like 100 times but he wasn't frustrated and that time it was dedication pushing us. It took 30 hours
            of
            practice to learn it and 20 hrs more to nail it, but we got it😀.
            <br>
            I am tired and can't think of anything else so no 2nd para.

        <p>
            Hola!<br>
            Day-3 it's hat-trick noice. So, lets see, today, I had group study or more like study duo
            it was nice, more like competion, what else ? Hmm! today I was not procastinating I was, I guess,
            just more occupied by contemplation and stuff like really deep one about like. I noticed in my english
            book
            most of the poems are there to tell how a bad a man is. Like in the poem <em>"For Anne Gregory"</em>
            captures the idea that men can't actually love women from heart, inetrnally or purely <em>"without any
                intention"</em>, they are hypnotised
            by their beauty or any of the physical characteristic, "like every man is flattered by Anne's honey
            locks(ramparts) in poem"
            it also conveys that he would stop loving her if she got rid of those lock. I am not the person of
            choise to
            counter this but as per my grasp it's not true well surely beauty or physique is one of the reasons but
            not
            the only reason even beatuy is just relative. Surely, what I like, someone will not like it. And saying
            men
            are heartless lust machines isn't right. But, maybe a BIG BUT the poem is trying to convey some higher
            level
            meaning which my mind can't currently absorb than I can be wrong, also I don't know enough of whatever
            this
            is.
            <br><br>
            Well, I guess just leave it, let's talk about grammar. I alway thought plural of person is people, but
            no
            its not true it can be persons too, infact in official documents the use persons as persons reffers to a
            group of people but each person distinctively and not as one body. Also peoples is also a legit word,
            whatt?
            Similarly, It reffers to different group of people but each group distinctively, for eg. <em>"Peoples of
                different races."</em> instead of <em>"People of different races."</em>
            Thats actually a bit strange.

        <p>
            Bonjour!<br>
            Day-2 hmm! surprising, made it so far. Well I guess it's the same time today 1:30 am
            and I am banging some nice music. But, today there is something nice I lost 1.2kg
            of weight ooo!🎉🎉 in around 3 weeks I dont know how's it's possible, ya, I changed
            my diet but believe me the change was abysmal, I didn't exercised more or anything,
            cycling maybe about 2-3km not much but yaa more or less it's fine (as long as it's not life threatning
            or
            something😅). My BMI(Body Mass Index) is normalish 20 something.
            <br><br>
            Nothing much happend <em>[`Currently the author is going through the boring repetitive stage of
                life,though it will perish slowly but surely`]</em> but lets think of something else.
            <br>
            I have toooo much rant but can't say it all in one day.
            Oh! speaking of units, our books are worst at it. Like sometimes they use KM then
            at other times it is Miles or Feets, sometimes Kelvin other times it's °Celcius,
            not even that sometimes they write M/S² other times it becomes MS⁻², I know it doesn't
            matter but I guess they can't choose a side, either British or American(It's tough I know)
            well but can't they atleast follow the same allover.
            <br>
            Also, Currently my social interaction is underoot(-1); yes, imaginary (those who didn't got it root(-1)
            =
            [i]maginary) my best friend is busy with their college my last chat was if not months then weeks ago
            (that too unread). I dont know why I always end with gloom.

            Hi! <br>
            So it's day-1 nothing intresting is going on other than I am writing this blog at <br>
            1:30 am 😂 it's 10 Jan (11 Jan actually) and my pre-boards start from 16 man I am not confident enough
            I am planning to give next 5 days purely to revising first exam is of Hindi, the one I am worst in.
            <br><br>
            Ya but I remember something, few weeks back I had my ASL (Assessment of Speaking and Listening) I was
            tense
            so in ASL two students argue on different topics and interrogate each other.
            When me and my partner took the seat I accidentally hit my teacher, it was clearly not my intention,
            the teacher got furious but she thought the child sitting next to me did it.
            she scolded him so bad as apparently he didn't even apologized I was sitting there watching all her
            fury bursting over him. I was feeling so guilty but my scare didn't let me say a thing.
            She is the teacher I have met so far but it is one of the guilt which floods my mind before I sleep
            (yes, there are a few more), I think I will apologize the next day but I guess I don't have the guts all
            though that teacher is a really good friend of mine, I look at her as a mentor. Even, she is the reason
            I
            am writing this today, she gave me the advice to write diary to express my feellings and wither away my
            anxiety.
            I thought of taking it a step further and write public diaries(believe me it's hard). So I guess I will
            never apologize her and him and regret my decision. 😐
            <br><br>
            Inference : Never! ever! lie. being silent is also considered as a filthy lie and will make you regret
            and feel guilty only. Better speak the truth no matter the acute consequences.
