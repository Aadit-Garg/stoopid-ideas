            <p>So! i am Aadit, I am creating this blog/diary site for fun and to face my public anxiety
                Its hard for me to open up in public but not any more <span class="brackets">(I guess😬)</span>.
                It can also be taken as a mental experiment that will writing blogs help me
                overcome my anxiety and help me open up.
                I believe this journey will be full of vivid emotions filled with life lessons, puns,
                heartbreaks <span class="brackets">(not really😅)</span>, witty incidents, study stuff <span
                    class="brackets">(as I am in high school😌)</span>.
                <br>Don't know whether someone gonna read it or not, though 😐.
                <br>
                <br>My objective is not to offend anyone in any shape or form.
                <br>
                <br><span class="brackets">(Why am I even doing this.)</span>
                <br>
                <br> It will be a 50-day <span class="quote">``blog my life``</span> challenge and I may continue it
                as
                my
                leisure.
